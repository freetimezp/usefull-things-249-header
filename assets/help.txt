High-precision | Heavy payload | Predictive maintenance

Diagnostics and live feed synchronize as you scroll — observe mechanical motions,
                        gear rotation and the reveal of the inspection line.


Scroll to reveal the inspection line and bring the arm into focus. The animation mimics an
                            industrial inspection rig moving along the line.


Predictive flags and alerts show up as you scroll — simulated here with motion and hue
                            shifts to call attention.


RPM, torque curves, efficiency.

Pressure, flow, temperature.
